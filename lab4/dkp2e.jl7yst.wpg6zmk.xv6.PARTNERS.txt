I figured out the functionality behind argint and got setwritecount to reset writecountâ€™s counter. 
Dhruv and Will set up the sys calls to be ready to use by xv6 in all the other files, while I added writecount.c 
and edited both setwritecount.c and syscall.c (both methods specifically).

I set up the xv6 to run using the terminal at first. I then switched to VSCode with the help of Will. 
Will and I then went to office hours where we both worked on the function writecount with both of us
 thinking and asking the TA for help. We also worked on implementing the setwritecount function but were
  unable to figure it out. Later I worked with Jacob to work on what we had for setwritecount and fix it to 
  have the function successfully change the count number to what we specify it to.

 I worked primarily with Dhruv in setting up the writecount function. We worked in tandem to create, test, 
 and troubleshoot issues with the writecount function. Eventually, we got it working. We did work to implement 
 the setwritecount function however I couldn't figure out how to set the value correctly. Dhruv and Jacob finished 
 the setwritecount method later.
